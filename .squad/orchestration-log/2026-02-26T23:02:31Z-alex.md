# Orchestration Log: Alex — 2026-02-26T23:02:31Z

## Assignment
- **Agent:** Alex
- **Reason:** Implement entitlements Helm release + kustomize overlays, vars, commit, PR
- **Mode:** background
- **Outcome:** Completed; PR #137 opened

## Execution Summary
Agent successfully completed the entitlements service porting to AKS Automatic pattern:
- Implemented `platform/helm_entitlements.tf` following partition template pattern
- Created kustomize overlays in `platform/kustomize/services/entitlements/`
- Added feature flag `enable_entitlements` (default true)
- Set entitlements depends on partition + common resources
- Pinned images: `cimpl-entitlements-v2-release:da367b9f` + bootstrap to `:67dedce7`
- Configured Redis image: `docker.io/library/redis:7`
- Committed changes and opened PR #137

## Artifacts
- Modified file: `platform/helm_entitlements.tf`
- Created: `platform/kustomize/services/entitlements/` overlays
- PR: #137 (entitlements service Helm release)
- Related issues: #85, #98, #99, #100, #103 (unblocked by image tag discovery)

## Decisions Applied
- **postrender-pattern:** Shared kustomize postrender framework for AKS safeguards compliance
- **service-namespace-strategy:** Namespaced service deployments with explicit ordering
- **subscriber-key-sourcing:** Environment variable pattern via Helm chart configuration

## Next Steps
- Code review of PR #137
- Merge when approved
- Begin next service port (legal, schema, storage, etc. per Phase 2–5 issue chain)
