#   # Latest CI builds (default)
#   ./scripts/resolve-chart-versions.ps1
#
#   # Pin to a release
#   $env:OSDU_CHART_VERSION = "0.29.0"
#   ./scripts/resolve-chart-versions.ps1
#
#   # Per-service overrides
#   $env:OSDU_SERVICE_VERSIONS = "entitlements=0.29.2,partition=0.29.0"
#   ./scripts/resolve-chart-versions.ps1
#
# The .auto.tfvars file is git-ignored — each deployment can pin different versions.
# Set OSDU_SKIP_VERSION_RESOLVE=true to skip auto-resolution.

# Default version for all OSDU services
# osdu_chart_version = "0.0.7-latest"

# Per-service version overrides
# osdu_service_versions = {
#   partition    = "0.29.0"
