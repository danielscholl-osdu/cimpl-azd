            Review this PR thoroughly using the project-specific checklist in CLAUDE.md.

            Focus on finding real bugs, not style nits. Specifically check:

            1. PowerShell: Missing $LASTEXITCODE checks after external commands (az, terraform, kubectl).
               This is the #1 source of silent failures in this codebase.
            2. PowerShell: Unquoted variable interpolation in command arguments (e.g., -state=$var must be "-state=$var").
            3. Terraform: AKS Automatic safeguards compliance (probes, resources, no :latest tags, seccomp).
            4. Terraform: Helm set blocks with boolean-like string values missing type = "string".
            5. Cross-layer: Correct state file paths for azd-managed terraform state.
            6. Security: No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive values.

            For each issue found, provide:
            - The exact file and line
            - What's wrong and why it matters
            - A concrete fix

            Do NOT say "no issues found" unless you have actually verified each item above against the diff.
