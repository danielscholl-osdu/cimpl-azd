            Read CLAUDE.md at the repo root for the project-specific code review checklist, then review every changed file against it.

            Focus on finding real bugs, not style nits. Key areas for this codebase:

            1. PowerShell: Missing $LASTEXITCODE checks after external commands (az, terraform, kubectl) — silent failures.
            2. PowerShell: Unquoted variable interpolation in arguments (e.g., -state=$var must be "-state=$var").
            3. Terraform: AKS Automatic safeguards compliance (probes, resources, no :latest tags, seccomp).
            4. Terraform: Helm set blocks with boolean-like string values missing type = "string".
            5. Cross-layer: Correct state file paths for azd-managed terraform state.
            6. Security: No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive values.

            For each issue found, cite the exact file and line, explain why it matters, and suggest a fix.
            If no real issues exist, briefly state what you verified rather than a generic "no issues found".
